# OCDLACheckout
OCDLACheckout is an Org-dependent unlocked package implementing standard ecommerce checkout facilities for customers.   These facilities can be divided into a main controller for converting a Salesforce Opportunity object to an Order object; and related Apex classes and Visualforce pages for managing the customer's payment and shipping methods.
